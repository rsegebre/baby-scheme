Baby Scheme:

As the name suggests this lab is a small version of scheme that I worked on a couple of years ago with a friend Ananya (Avi) Das. We wrote all of the code
and came up with various test cases. The main point of the exercise was to write a program with various classes and JUnit Test cases.

This lab was for my COSC 303 class on Principles of Design for Large Systems (a.k.a. Software Engineering) with Prof. Jamie Spacco (aweeeesome guy!).
